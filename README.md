#Chapter 9
Creating objects utilizes memory.

Memory is stored in stack and heap.

Stack = method invocation and local vars.
Heap = objects and instance vars.

InstVar is declared in class, LocalVar is declared and only used in methods.
All classes have default constructors if not specified.

Can chain constructors down an inheritance tree using super.

this() can be used to invoke overloaded constructors inside a constructor.

this() and super() cannot be in the same constructor.

#Chapter 10

Static methods cannot use non-static variables.

Static methods can be called w/o object. Not dependant on instVar.

Non static methods can use both static and non-static vars.

Static final is constant in a class.

java.util.Calendar can be used to manipulate dates and times.
